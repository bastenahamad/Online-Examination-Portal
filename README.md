## Project Overview

The **Online Examination Portal** is developed to simplify the examination process for both students and instructors. It provides a platform for conducting online exams effortlessly, with features for managing questions, answers, and evaluating student performance.

The portal offers a seamless experience with a user-friendly interface for both examinees and administrators. The admin can input questions into the database, while the examinees can log in and take their tests. The system automatically assesses the students and identifies whether they pass or fail.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Separate login for examinees and administrators.
- **Photo Verification**: Ensures authenticity of examinees during login.
- **Question Management**: Allows admin to input and update questions.
- **Automatic Evaluation**: Exam results are calculated automatically, saving time on manual correction.
- **Result Retrieval**: Instructors can easily find which students passed or failed the exam.
- **Scalable Backend**: Efficient storage and retrieval of data using MongoDB.

## Technologies Used

1. **HTML**:  
   HTML provides the structure for the portal. It includes:
   - Headings and paragraphs for page content.
   - Links for navigation between different sections of the portal.
   - Buttons for triggering actions.
   - Forms for collecting input data from users.

2. **CSS**:  
   CSS is used to style the website and improve user experience:
   - Fonts, colors, and layouts are managed using CSS.
   - Animations and transitions provide a dynamic look and feel to the portal.

3. **JavaScript**:  
   JavaScript handles client-side interactions, such as:
   - Triggering actions when buttons are clicked.
   - Validating input data.
   - Managing cookies and local storage for a smoother user experience.

4. **Node.js**:  
   Node.js is used for server-side operations, such as:
   - Processing exam results.
   - User authentication and session management.
   - Real-time communication between the client and server.
   - Managing large numbers of concurrent users.

5. **MongoDB**:  
   MongoDB is the backend database, offering:
   - Scalable and flexible storage for exam questions, user details, and results.
   - High performance for handling heavy traffic and large datasets.
   - Easy retrieval of results and user information.

## Project Benefits

- **Streamlined Exam Process**: Eliminates the need for manual exam handling and grading, reducing the time taken to evaluate and release results.
- **Error-Free Results**: Automated evaluation reduces the risk of human errors during correction.
